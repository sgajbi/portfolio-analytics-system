# alembic.ini
# A generic, cross-db configuration.
#
# This file is used by Alembic to configure database migrations.
# It defines paths, log configuration, and database connection details.
#
# For more information, see the Alembic documentation:
# https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html

[alembic]
# path to migration scripts
script_location = alembic

# template used to generate new migration scripts
# (comment out to use the default one)
# template_path = %(script_location)s/script.py.mako

# timezone for timestamps in revision files, can be set to "local"
# or any valid tz database timezone string (e.g. "Europe/London")
# timezone = UTC

# The URL to connect to the database.
# This value can be a direct SQLAlchemy connection string.
# When running in Docker, it's often preferred to configure this via environment variables
# which are then picked up by alembic/env.py.
# If this is commented out, alembic/env.py will look for DATABASE_URL env variable.
# sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:password@localhost/portfolio_db # COMMENTED OUT THIS LINE
# The value "sqlalchemy.url" is used by the default env.py to connect to the database.
# It can be overwritten by the "DATABASE_URL" environment variable if configured in env.py.
