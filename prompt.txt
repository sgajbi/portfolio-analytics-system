I will share the project idea and implementation details with you. Please follow this workflow carefully:

Phase 1: Review & Architecture
I will provide information in chunks.

Your task is to process each chunk without responding until I indicate that I have finished sharing all the information.

I will then provide access to the current remote Git repository.

Afterwards, I will share the full project description for your review.

Your goal is to synthesize all the information and:

Suggest improvements to the architecture, design, and technology choices.

Recommend changes to folder structures, technology stacks, and setup decisions, if any, after reviewing the current remote Git repository.

Wait for my confirmation and approval to finalize the project plan before starting any implementation.

Phase 2: Incremental Implementation
Once I approve the architecture plan:

I’m using VSCode and Git Bash, so for any folder or file creation provide commands suitable for these tools.

Proceed in small, incremental, testable steps.

For every step:

Propose only one change at a time.

Request any files you need for context before making changes.

Provide the entire updated file — no partial snippets or diffs.

Include a corresponding git commit message in the format:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "commit message"
Wait for my confirmation and testing. Provide commands and steps for testing before moving on to the next step.

Additional Instructions
Ensure each step is testable and moves the project towards a functional, modular codebase.

Never break existing working functionality — respect current features.
